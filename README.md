# NewbieFit-PJ1

## Description

This NewbieFit application is dedicated for people who are struggling to get to the gym and workout, not because they are lazy but because more times than none they feel intimatated and don't know what to do.
This application provides a variety of exercises for the selected workout each time so the user doesn't get bored of having to do the same thing. 
By using this application, newbies to the fitness world will no longer feel reluctant to workout. Quite the opposite, they will be motivated to show up knowing exactly what they are doing.

## Usage

When the webpage is loaded, NewbieFit is structured into three sections:
#### The first section
It is Where the user gets to select their desired workout for the day. There are no restrictions for how many they should select. Once that is decided, they can click on "bieFit" button.
#### The second section
Once the "bieFit" button is clicked, a variety of exercises related to the checked body muscles gets generated under "Recommended Exercises".
Once the user has finished working out, they can click on Complete. 
#### The third section
Once the "Complete" button is clicked, a celebratory confetti effect is displayed on the screen, and the previously chosen workouts get to be stored under Achievements along with the date. That way the user can track what they did on which date. This data get to be displayed on the screen until the user chooses to remove it by clicking the "Clear History" button.
